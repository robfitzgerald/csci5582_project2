STRIPS (initial-state, goals)
– state = initial-state; plan = []; stack = []
– Push goals on stack
– Repeat until stack is empty
• If top of stack is goal that matches state, then pop stack
• Else if top of stack is a conjunctive goal g, then
– Select an ordering for the subgoals of g, and push them on
stack
• Else if top of stack is a simple goal sg, then
– Choose an operator o whose add-list matches goal sg
– Replace goal sg with operator o
– Push the preconditions of o on the stack
• Else if top of stack is an operator o, then
– state = apply(o, state)
– plan = [plan; o]
