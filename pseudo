move wraps a statement

controller p2Ctrl
    holds the current state statement

factory blocksWorldOperations
    has the data for each operation type
    blocksWorldOperations.generateOperations(predicate)
        returns array of moves

we need to check the op.a(x,y)
    current



currentState.matchPredicate(someOperation)

for this to work, one needs to be strictly less than

we need the other operation... blarg.  ok.
